    title: "What is AlgoVista?",
    content: `
AlgoVista is an interactive platform designed to help you visualize and understand data structures and algorithms.
Our goal is to make learning these complex computer science concepts intuitive, engaging, and accessible for everyone.

### Key Motivations
- **Visual Learning**: We believe that seeing algorithms in action, step-by-step with synchronized code, is crucial for building strong mental models.
- **Interactive Engagement**: Move beyond passive reading. Test algorithms with your own data, control animation speed, and see the logic unfold.
- **Modern Experience**: Enjoy a clean, intuitive interface designed with current web standards, including light/dark modes and responsive design.

AlgoVista now covers a wide range of topics, from fundamental sorting and searching algorithms to complex tree and graph traversals, dynamic programming, and various data structure operations.

  "getting-started/how-to-use": {
    title: "How to Use AlgoVista",
    content: `
Using AlgoVista is designed to be intuitive:

1.  **Navigate to Visualizers**: From the main navigation, select "Visualizers" to see the list of available algorithms and data structures.
2.  **Choose a Topic**: Click on any card (e.g., "Bubble Sort", "Binary Search Tree", "DFS") to open its dedicated interactive page.
3.  **Interact with the Visualizer**:
    *   **Input Data**: Most visualizers will have input field(s) where you can provide your own data (e.g., a comma-separated list of numbers for sorting, values for tree nodes, graph structure strings). Default data is usually provided.
    *   **Control Panel**: Use the control buttons:
        *   **Play/Pause**: Start or pause the step-by-step animation.
        *   **Step**: Manually advance the algorithm one step at a time.
        *   **Reset/Execute**: Resets the visualization to its initial state with the current input or executes the selected operation.
    *   **Animation Speed**: Adjust the slider to control how fast the animation plays.
4.  **Understand the Components**:
    *   **Visualization Panel**: This is the main area where the data structure or algorithm's state is animated (e.g., array bars changing, tree nodes highlighting, graph traversals).
    *   **Code Panel**: Displays conceptual code (often in multiple languages like JavaScript, Python, Java, C++) corresponding to the algorithm being visualized. The currently executing line or block of code is typically highlighted.
    *   **Algorithm Details Card**: Found below the visualizer, this card provides:
        *   A detailed description of the algorithm/data structure.
        *   Time and Space Complexity analysis (Best, Average, Worst cases).
        *   Common use cases.
5.  **Explore Documentation**: Use this Docs section (\`/docs\`) to delve deeper into theoretical concepts, understand algorithm categories, or get help with platform features.

### Tips for Effective Learning
-   **Start with Fundamentals**: If you're new, begin with simpler algorithms like Linear Search or Bubble Sort before moving to more complex ones.
-   **Experiment with Inputs**: Try various inputs: sorted, reverse-sorted, small, large (within limits), edge cases (empty, single element) to see how algorithms respond.
-   **Predict and Verify**: Before clicking "Step" or "Play", try to predict what the algorithm will do next. Then, observe if your prediction was correct.
-   **Connect Visuals to Code**: Actively switch your focus between the visualization panel and the highlighted code in the code panel to understand how the visual changes map to the code logic.
-   **Read the Details**: Don't skip the Algorithm Details card; it provides crucial context and theoretical backing.

  "algorithms-visualized/time-and-space-complexity": {
    title: "Time and Space Complexity",
    content: `
Understanding time and space complexity is fundamental to analyzing algorithms.

### ‚è≥ Time Complexity
Measures time taken as a function of input size (N), using Big O notation (worst-case).
-   **O(1)**: Constant time. E.g., array index access.
-   **O(log N)**: Logarithmic time. E.g., Binary Search.
-   **O(N)**: Linear time. E.g., Traversing an array.
-   **O(N log N)**: Log-Linear. E.g., Merge Sort, Heap Sort.
-   **O(N¬≤)**: Quadratic time. E.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort.
-   **O(2^N)**: Exponential time. E.g., Naive recursive Fibonacci.
-   **O(N!)**: Factorial time. E.g., Brute-force Traveling Salesperson.

### üíæ Space Complexity
Measures memory used relative to input size.
-   **O(1)**: Constant space (auxiliary). E.g., In-place Bubble Sort.
-   **O(N)**: Linear space. E.g., Copying an array, recursion stack for path graph DFS.
-   **O(N¬≤)**: Quadratic space. E.g., Adjacency matrix.

Complexities help predict performance as data scales, guiding algorithm choice.
