# AlgoVista: See Algorithms in Action

![AlgoVista](https://placehold.co/1200x630.png)
<!-- Replace with an actual project banner/screenshot -->

**AlgoVista** is an interactive, web-based educational platform designed to make learning complex computer science concepts, like data structures and algorithms, intuitive and engaging. Instead of just reading static code, users can watch algorithms unfold step-by-step through dynamic visualizations, synchronized with the underlying code.

## üåü About The Project

Our mission is to bridge the gap between abstract theory and practical understanding. AlgoVista provides a clear, panoramic view ("Vista") of how algorithms work internally, helping students, self-taught developers, and engineers build strong mental models and prepare for technical challenges.

### ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Interactive Visualizers**: A growing library of dynamic visualizations for sorting, searching, trees, graphs, and more.
-   **Step-by-Step Execution**: Control the pace of the animation with play, pause, and step-through controls.
-   **Synchronized Code Panel**: See the lines of code highlight in real-time as the visualization progresses. Supports multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, C++).
-   **Customizable Inputs**: Test algorithms with your own data to see how they behave with different inputs, including edge cases.
-   **In-Depth Explanations**: Each visualizer is accompanied by a detailed card explaining the algorithm's logic, time/space complexity, and common use cases.
-   **Comprehensive Docs**: A dedicated documentation section to explore concepts more deeply.
-   **Modern, Responsive UI**: A clean, accessible interface with light and dark modes, built for any device.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

AlgoVista is built on a modern, robust, and type-safe technology stack:

-   [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) - The React Framework for Production.
-   [**React**](https://react.dev/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For strong typing and improved code quality.
-   [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
-   [**Shadcn/UI**](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - Beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable components.
-   [**Lucide React**](https://lucide.dev/) - For clean and consistent icons.
-   [**Genkit**](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) - A potential future addition for AI-powered features.
-   [**Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com/) - For hosting and backend services.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later) and npm installed on your machine.

-   npm
    ```sh
    npm install npm@latest -g
    ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/visheshraghuvanshi/AlgoVista.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd AlgoVista
    ```
3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

The page will auto-update as you edit the files.

## üìñ Usage

1.  Navigate to the [**Visualizers**](http://localhost:9002/visualizers) page to browse all available algorithms.
2.  Select an algorithm to open its dedicated visualization page.
3.  Use the controls to input data, adjust speed, and step through the animation.
4.  Read the detailed explanation and complexity analysis provided on the page.
